### Hello Friend... 👋 My name is David, a web development enthusiast and passionate learner. Currently, I am focused on learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a keen interest in building responsive and accessible websites. I'm still a beginner though, but I'm excited to share my projects and progress with the world.






- 🔭 I’m currently working on myself to improve my skills and understanding of web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript also interested in learning a CSS framework soon.
- 💬 Ask me about web developement (HTML, CSS, and maybe JavaScript 😄) + 'how to breed rabbits'.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me @ dakinola54@gmail.com. I'm always happy to chat with fellow developers and exchange ideas.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I code to prove a point to my Dad...
