### Hello Friend... ðŸ‘‹ My name is David, a web development enthusiast and passionate learner. Currently, I am focused on learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a keen interest in building responsive and accessible websites. I'm still a beginner though, but I'm excited to share my projects and progress with the world.






- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on myself to improve my skills and understanding of web development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web developement (HTML, CSS, and maybe JavaScript ðŸ˜„)
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/webForDave?t=JRbX-XK6vMDLcavDgg&s=09">Twitter</a> I'm always happy to chat with fellow developers and exchange ideas.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once spent hours wondering why my JavaScript code wasn't working, only to realize that I forgot to link my script file to my HTML.
